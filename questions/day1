1. How much is the current memory capacity of a canister?
Canisters can now hold 48GiB of stable memory

2. What is the issue with the following code sample?

actor {
  let counter : Nat = 0;
  public func increment_counter() : async () {
    counter := counter + 1;
  };
}

The first error you'll get is "expected mutable assignment target"
its because the variable counter is declared as immutable which means that the value declared can't be changed.
To fix that you have to change the keyword from let to var.


3.What is the issue with the following code sample?
actor {
  var message : Text = 0;

  public query func change_message(new_message : Text) : async () {
    message := new_message;
    return;
  };
  
  public query func see_message() : async Text {
    return(message);
  };
}
the error you'll get "does not have expected type Text" a syntax error, to fix the error you just have to use the "quotation marks" around the text

actor {
  var message : Text = "0";
  
  
4. False or True: we can remove the keyword async for return argument of a query function since queries are faster to answer.

  False. The async keyword is used to indicate that a function is asynchronous, meaning that it can run concurrently with other code and does not block the execution 
  of other code while it is running. In the case of a query function, 
  it is used to indicate that the function does not modify the state of the canister and it is expected to return faster than a function that modifies the state.
